# Data Gathering Plan for Crypto Trading Bot (11/6/2023)

## Project Overview
The goal is to develop a versatile trading bot powered by neural network algorithms. While this is my first machine learning (ML) project, my solid understanding of cryptocurrencies and the market dynamics will guide the development process.

## Strategy
Based on discussions with GPT, the bot will be fed a diverse dataset to trade a range of cryptocurrencies and adjust to varying market conditions.

## Initial Steps for Data Collection
1. **Gather Extensive Historical Data**: Obtain data going back as far as possible for various assets. This provides a comprehensive view of market behaviors over different periods.

## Additional Recommendations
- **Data Sources**: Identify and utilize multiple data sources to enhance the dataset's robustness. Consider sources like Binance for market-related data and Blockchain.com for on-chain metrics.
- **Data Storage and Management**: Ensure the data infrastructure can handle the volume and complexity of the data. Employ databases suited for time-series data.
- **Feature Engineering**: Beyond price data, include technical indicators and blockchain analytics to enrich the model's learning potential.
- **Preprocessing**: Develop a preprocessing pipeline that includes data cleaning, normalization, and transformation.
- **Modeling**: Begin with simpler models to establish baselines before progressing to more complex neural networks.
- **Validation and Testing**: Implement rigorous backtesting using historical data to validate the strategy. Employ out-of-sample testing to avoid overfitting.
- **Documentation**: Keep detailed documentation of the data gathering process, model architecture, and evaluation criteria.
- **Compliance**: Stay informed about regulatory requirements related to automated trading systems.
- **Security**: Implement strict security measures to protect API keys and sensitive data.

## Next Steps
- **Iterative Development**: Start with a minimum viable model and iterate based on feedback and performance.
- **Risk Management**: Establish clear risk management protocols, including stop-loss orders and position sizing.
- **Continuous Learning**: Plan for ongoing model training and refinement to adapt to new market conditions.

Remember, the key to a successful ML project is incremental progress and continuous learning. Start with manageable goals, and scale up as you gain more insights and confidence.
